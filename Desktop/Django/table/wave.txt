</html>We’ve strayed from the point slightly… We were talking about flex-direction and axes. To bring it back home, the default behavior is flex-direction: row which arranges things horizontally. The reason this often works well without changing other details in the CSS is because block-level elements default to the full width of their parent. Changing things to vertical using flex-direction: column adds complexity because block-level elements default to the height of their content, and in this case there is no content.
